2. Catalog information about Index
- Show what catalog information you store for an index. 
First and foremost we needed to store the names of the attributes we were working with. 

3. Index Nested Loop Join
- Describe how your Index Nested Loop Join works.


4. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
  No we did not.

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.

- Other implementation details:

  Filter: 
  
    Here i will go through the implementations features of the filter class.
    
    Constructor:
    Ive added an iterator, vector and Comparison fields to the Filter class to assist in holding information.
    All the constructor does is intitlize the firsst two of these fields, the third will be filled later.
    
    getNextTuple:
    I implemented this function recursively since most of it could be  partitioned into a single helper function.
    In this case that helper function is called verify, as the name suggests
    
    getAttributes:
    outsources the work to the Iterator class, isnt really used since we intitlize with constructor.
