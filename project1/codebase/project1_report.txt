2. Internal Record Format
- We were planning on using a 2D-vector struct, but were unable to implement this feature. This would have allowed us to index each page and slot number, enabling us to lookup each element in O(1) time. 
- VarChars were stored by determining the length of the individual string/char array and multiplying that by the bytes containted in a single character of VarChar. 


3. Page Format
- Then pages are 4096 bytes, as defined in the original header file. They contain the data passed into the rbf methods writepage and appendpage


4. Implementation Detail
- rbf.cc:
	PagedFileManager
	createFile(fileName) : Runs a check if the fileName exists, if it succeeds
			       Then it creates a new file called fileName using ofstream
	destroyFile(fileName) : First, it must change the c++ string* to a const char* to match the type for the standard c function. 
				Then it uses remove(fileName) returning its succ/fail val.
	openFile(fileName, fileHandle) : Again, first it converts string* to const char*
					 Then it opens the file using fopen with the ability to read with binary (fixed with bug on fseek later) 
					 and checks if the file was successfully opened. Last it sets the handle in fileHandle to the file opened.
	closeFile(fileHandle) : Uses the getter in fileHandle to recieve the file set as its handle and closes it, returns its succ/fail val
	
	
	FileHandle
	FileHandle() : Same constructor but added the pointer to a file which will be used in the next methods. Also added a getter and setter
		       to access and set the file in the constructor.
	writePage(pageNum, *data) : First, checks that the page is a valid page number (comparing with total pages)
				   Then, uses fseek to go to the page number. This is tricky because fseek goes byte by byte and we need have it skip 
				   by the size of a page. So multiply PAGE_SIZE (4096 bytes) by the pageNum value. Now that the current state of the fseek 
				   if on the pagenum we want, we use fwrite to write the *data with PAGE_SIZE bytes and then fflush finishes writing 
				   all the set changes to the file. Last it increments the writePageCounter.
	appendPage(*data) : This seeks to the end of the file and writes a page at the end of the file. It writes the same way as writePage by fflushing the
			    data to the file after it is staged to write. It increments the appendPageCounter.
	readPage(pageNum, *data) : It has the same first steps as writePage with regards to checking the pageNum and fseeking to the proper page. Now it just
				   reads the page at that location to data aand increments the readPageCounter.
	getNumberofPages() : This seeks to the end of the file and collects the state of the cursor with ftell. This number is the total bits, so it is required
			     to divide it by PAGE_SIZE to achieve how many pages are in the file.
	collectCounterValues(readPageCount, writePageCount, appendPageCount) :
			    It sets all the parameter values to the values of the current counters in the FileHandle instance.

	
-rbfm.cc
	The functions createFile, destroyFile, openFile, and closeFile were all based on creating instances of the already implemented functions in pfm.cc. Each function instantiated PFM and did routine checks to make sure the files were handled correctly. 
	insertRecord(fileHandle, recordDescriptor, *data, rid) : Depending on which page number is created, we either append a page to the existing pages, to place records in or create an inital page. We then check to see how much memory will be needed for allocation. Then we find the next point available for record writing and insert the record by copying the memory to a usable type. 
	readRecord(fileHandle, recordDescriptor, rid, *data) : Find a block of memory given by rid and copy that memory onto the data block for reads. 
	printRecord(recordDiscriptor, *data) : This function works by searching for distinct data type represented within the recordDescriptor's indices, copying them into an interpretable type in memory and printing the associated attribute type out along with its value.
